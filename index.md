## News

One paper accepted in ICRA 2020

Our journal version of the Multimodal Representation paper has been accepted to T-RO

Our paper [Guided Uncertainty Aware Policy Optimization](http://www.robot-learning.ml/2019/files/papers/Guided%20Uncertainty-Aware%20Policy%20Optimization:%20Combining%20Learning%20and%20Model-Based%20Strategies%20for%20Sample-Efficient%20Policy%20Learning.pdf) won best paper at the Robot Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2019. 

One paper accepted in IROS 2019. 

We won the Best Conference Paper Award at ICRA 2019 in Montreal. We also were the Best Award in Cognitive Robotics Finalist.
